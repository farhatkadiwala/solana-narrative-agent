      "description": "Players use Seeker's NFC to tap-to-join live poker tables at venues, with encrypted hole cards via Token Extensions' confidential transfers. ZK compression stores every hand in tournament history on-chain for 5000x cheaper than traditional blockchains. Blinks enable instant tournament registration from any social platform. Real-world venues get revenue share, players get provably fair games with complete hand history transparency.",
